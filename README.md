Instructions for 2018 IEEE Machine Learning Workshop attendees.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you all for signing up for the workshops. Please check the event page for schedule and the address: 
https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ieee-workshops-on-machine-learning-convolutional-neural-networks-and-tensorflow-tickets-45668033317

A.Logistics: 
------------------------------------------

1. All the attendees are requested to arrive before 4pm on 9/24 and 9/25 to ensure smooth check-in. The workshop starts at 4.15pm on each day.We are expecting 125+ attendees on-site and there would be WebEx avaiilable for 
Texas Instruments Employees from remote sites. 
2. Snacks are provided at the start of the event with
the sandwiches for dinner on Mon and Pizza on tue. Both vegetarian diet is also provided in additition
to meat based diet. 
3. Course slides will be sent as pdf by Friday noon.

*****4. If you are attending day 2 of workshop to do interactive programming exercsises, 
you must prepare the laptop with the setup in advance before the workshop based 
on the following instructions.****



B. WiFi and Power Sockets
---------------------------------------
1. There is no WiFi and no power sockets available for attendees in TI auditorium.
Please bring a fully charged laptop along with the software installed as per section C below.
Espcially on day-2, your laptop should last atleast for 2 hours for the interactive exercises.

(We have limited WiFi connectivity and access to power sockets in the auditorium-this is mainly for 
5 course volunteers who would be helping the attendees. If you need to use WiFi on laptop for any purpose,
you may want to tether to your mobile phone's hotspot.However please **do not count** on installing the software packages 
while on mobile tethering as the software packages for Python and tensorflow are **very large**. These best can be installed
while on high speed connection at work or at home)


C. This Important notice is applicable for people who are attending Day 2 of the workshop.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. You must prepare the laptop with the setup in advance before the workshop based on the following instructions.

Follow the instructions based on your preference:

Install with Windows: See Windows_README.MD

Install with Linux: See Linux_README.MD

Install with Docker on Windows or Linux: See Docker_README.MD

Install with MacOS: See Mac_README.MD


This process installs several python and tensorflow packages using pip command or docker command. 
For this you need internet connection.
Also you should download the repo as the repo has local data so that the program can be run without 
needing network connection to get the data.

 ***********************************************************************************************
 You ***MUST*** complete the install process and downloading of course materials before coming to the Day *1* of workshop . 
 ***********************************************************************************************

Note that laptop with software is not needed on Day 1. It is only needed on Day 2 of workshop.
In case of any issues, you can be helped on Day 1 for Day 2 of workshop.

Help on Setup
-----------------------------------

3. What to do if you face setup issues before the workshop:
The setup is infact quite simple if you have a latest Tensorflow installation. 
Only additional thing to do download the course materials and repo and then do install additinal packages using
pip install -r requirements.txt  

In any case, if you encounter any issues,

Help is available through Google Groups on 9/20 to 9/23: If you face any issues with the setup, please join the Google Groups
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ieee-machine-learning-workshop
and ask your question there, if it is not already answered. 
We have a team of volunteers monitoring this group to address any issues. 
Remote help through Google Hangouts is available-but would be very limited.

You can also reach us directly through eventbrite contact page or 
the course email address(though which we reached out to all the attendees).


4. For attendees who still have setup issues and whose issues were not resolved through Google Groups:

For attendees who registered for both days: Limited installation help is available on the first evening of the workshop 
For attendees who registered for 2nd day: Very limited installation help is available on the second evening of the workshop 


5. It is important for all the attendees to come prepared with a working installation so that we focus on the programming and the concepts.
